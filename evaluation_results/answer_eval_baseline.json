      "expected": "Societies of control differ from disciplinary institutions in fundamental ways. Disciplinary societies operated through enclosed spaces and institutions like hospitals, factories, schools, and prisons. These institutions were molds or distinct castings with a common analogical language. In contrast, societies of control operate through inseparable variations that form a system of variable geometry with a numerical language. Control mechanisms are modulations, like self-deforming casts that continuously change from one moment to another, or like sieves whose mesh transmutes from point to point. For example, in the factory system, workers were contained as a single body at an equilibrium level. However, in a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory and operates as a spirit or gas, imposing modulation of each salary through states of perpetual metastability that operate via challenges, contests, and group sessions. This represents a shift from fixed institutional structures to continuous, fluid mechanisms of control that adapt and change constantly.",

      "expected": "In disciplinary societies, there are two poles that define how power operates: the signature that designates the individual, and the number or administrative numeration that indicates his or her position within a mass. However, in the societies of control, what is important is no longer either a signature or a number, but a code. The code functions as a password, whereas disciplinary societies are regulated by watchwords. The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information or reject it. In disciplinary societies, we find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair, but in societies of control, individuals have become \"dividuals,\" and masses have become samples, data, markets, or \"banks.\" Perhaps it is money that expresses the distinction between the two societies best, since discipline always referred back to minted money that locks gold in as numerical standard, while control relates to floating rates of exchange, modulated according to a rate established by a set of standard currencies.

The context indicates that:\n- No comparable assumption of a pre-existing national identity existed\n- Nationalism had to be **constructed** through state apparatus rather than discovered in pre-existing spiritual/cultural domains\n- The nation required deliberate formation and galvanization of citizenry around state-created points of identity\n\n## The Fundamental Difference\nIndian nationalism could draw on an ideological foundation that separated spiritual authenticity from material/political control, allowing for a sense of national identity independent of colonial political rule. Singapore, lacking this ideological framework, required the state itself to actively construct and maintain national identity through deliberate apparatus and rhetoric.",

Crucially, the Indian nation was conceptualized as always already existing, waiting in the wings even before political independence, with national authenticity residing in the spiritual domain through notions of cultural tradition, family, and Indian women. In contrast, Singapore's nationhood was not assumed to exist prior to political formation; rather, it was thrust upon the nation, requiring it to \"swim or sink.\" Unlike Indian nationalism, which could draw upon an alternative vision of cultural and territorial sovereignty rooted in spiritual authenticity, no such assumption could easily attend Singaporean nationalism given the island's various conceptualizations as part of the Straits Settlements, a separate British colony, part of Malaysia, and finally an independent nation. Consequently, the Singaporean state, dominated by the People's Action Party since independence, has had to actively construct national identity through state apparatus and representational strategies, including education policies, state-sponsored spectacles such as National Day parades, public education messages, manipulation of space through public housing, and ideologies of multiracialism and heteronormativity, thereby producing knowledge about the nation through deliberate state intervention.",

Literature helps show the fractious and contingent nature of nation-formation that official history textbooks and state-sanctioned rhetoric of nationalism tend to gloss over. While literature may not present sustained and coherent visions or fully articulated alternatives, it remains powerfully suggestive through passing, sidelong glances and beginning utterances as a necessary step towards disrupting the state-established racial, spatial and historical paradigms for imagining the nation.

This suggests Holmes is willing to manipulate public perception and credit for cases, though the context here is somewhat ambiguous about his true motivations.\n\nOverall, the passage portrays Holmes as someone primarily concerned with the intellectual challenge of his cases rather than with public acclaim or the broader social good, though he is not entirely indifferent to how cases affect others' reputations.",

      "expected": "Koei Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1978 by husband-and-wife duo Y\u014dichi and Keiko Erikawa. Y\u014dichi, a Keio University student, decided to pursue programming after his family's rural dyestuffs business failed. The company was located in the Hiyoshi area of Yokohama near Y\u014dichi's alma mater, with its name being a spoonerism. Initially, Koei focused on personal computer sales and made-to-order business software. In 1983, the company released Nobunaga's Ambition, a historical strategy game set during Japan's Sengoku period, which received numerous awards and led to the development of other historically-themed games such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Uncharted Waters. To expand internationally, Koei established a North American subsidiary, Koei Corporation, in California in 1988, which localized games for export and produced original games under designer Stieg Hedlund. After Hedlund's departure, this subsidiary ceased game development in 1995 and focused on localization, sales, and marketing. The company further expanded by establishing a Canadian subsidiary, Koei Canada, Inc., in early 2001, and a European subsidiary, Koei Limited, in early 2003 in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.",

      "expected": "The Watergate scandal was a political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon. On June 17, 1972, operatives associated with Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at Washington, D.C.'s Watergate complex. The break-in was an implementation of Operation Gemstone, enacted by mostly Cuban burglars led by former intelligence agents E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy. After their arrests, investigators and reporters like The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2014guided by the leaker \"Deep Throat\"\u2014exposed a White House political espionage program illegally funded by donor contributions. Nixon denied involvement, but his administration destroyed evidence, obstructed investigators, and bribed the burglars. The cover-up initially worked, helping Nixon win a landslide re-election, until revelations from the burglars' 1973 trial emerged. Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed Archibald Cox as Watergate special prosecutor. Cox subpoenaed Nixon's Oval Office tapes, but Nixon invoked executive privilege to block their release, triggering a constitutional crisis. In the \"Saturday Night Massacre\", Nixon fired Cox, forcing the resignations of the attorney general and his deputy. Nixon released select tapes, although one was partially erased and two others disappeared. In July 1974, the Supreme Court ordered the tapes' release, and the House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment for obstructing justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. The White House released the \"Smoking Gun\" tape, showing that Nixon ordered the CIA to stop the FBI's investigation. Facing impeachment, on August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign. In total, 69 people were charged for Watergate, and most pleaded guilty or were convicted. The scandal tarnished Nixon's legacy and had electoral ramifications for the Republican Party, including heavy losses in the 1974 midterm elections.",
